	Abstract = {Mesic deciduous forest herbs often disperse seed with morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) that prevents germination during unfavorable periods for seedling survival. However, for seeds of some species with MPD, seasonal separation of root and shoot emergence and variation in dormancy levels can complicate interpretation of seedling emergence timing in the field. We tested whether dormancy-break and germination requirements differed among co-occurring perennial forest herbs, Actaea racemosa, Hydrastis canadensis, and Sanguinaria canadensis, which are wild-harvested for their medicinal properties and known to have MPD. Seeds of all species exhibited a summer →autumn →winter requirement for seedling emergence in spring. However, species differed in seed-bank persistence due to variation in primary dormancy levels and stratification requirement of seeds. A. racemosa and H. canadensis can form short-term persistent seed bank, whereas S. canadensis can form a long-term persistent seed-bank, regardless of whether elaiosomes were removed from seeds prior to burial. A. racemosa seeds are dispersed in autumn with weak physiological dormancy, as seeds germinated to high rates at 15/6$\,^{\circ}$C after 8 weeks. In contrast, most seeds of the summer dispersed species, H. canadensis and S. canadensis, require summer temperatures to overcome physiological dormancy. Consequently, seedling emergence is reduced and delayed by 1 year if seeds are not sown immediately following the period of natural dispersal. Seedling emergence was much lower in the field than in controlled conditions for all species, especially in the small-seeded A. racemosa. Interspecific variation in dormancy levels and germination traits must be considered when establishing populations for conservation purposes and in understanding recruitment limitation in perennial forest herbs.},

Although seed banks are dynamic entities controlled by multiple environmental drivers, climatic factors are the most comprehensive, but still poorly understood. This study investigates how climatic variation structures seed production and resulting seed bank patterns. Location Temperate forests along a 1900?km latitudinal gradient in north-western (NW) Europe. Methods Seed production and seed bank density were quantified in 153 plots along the gradient for four forest herbs with different seed longevity: Geum urbanum, Milium effusum, Poa nemoralis and Stachys sylvatica. We tested the importance of climatic and local environmental factors in shaping seed production and seed bank density. Results Seed production was determined by population size, and not by climatic factors. G.?urbanum and M.?effusum seed bank density declined with decreasing temperature (growing degree days) and/or increasing temperature range (maximum?minimum temperature). P.?nemoralis and S.?sylvatica seed bank density were limited by population size and not by climatic variables. Seed bank density was also influenced by other, local environmental factors such as soil pH or light availability. Different seed bank patterns emerged due to differential seed longevities. Species with long-lived seeds maintained constant seed bank densities by counteracting the reduced chance of regular years with high seed production at colder northern latitudes. Main conclusions Seed bank patterns show clear interspecific variation in response to climate across the distribution range. Not all seed banking species may be as well equipped to buffer climate change via their seed bank, notably in short-term persistent species. Since the buffering capacity of seed banks is key to species persistence, these results provide crucial information to advance climatic change predictions on range shifts, community and biodiversity responses.},

@article{Plue:2012aa,
	Abstract = {This study investigates how methodological aspects of seed-bank sampling affect seed-bank records in temperate deciduous forests. We focused explicitly on seed-bank records of ancient forest species, which are assumed to lack a persistent seed bank; a hypothesis suspected to be partly due to methodological shortcomings. Through a quantitative review of 31 seed-bank studies in temperate deciduous forests of central and north-west Europe, we quantified the role of sampling methodology in constraining total seed-bank records and seed-bank records of ancient forest species (γ-diversity, average species' retrieval frequency and average seed density). A major methodological trade-off was established between sampled plot area and the number of plots: at an increased number of plots, the area sampled per plot decreased significantly. The total surface area sampled in a study was the primary determinant of γ-diversity, both for overall species richness and for ancient forest species richness. A high retrieval frequency of ancient forest species indicated that few plots were intensively sampled. The parallel increase in total species richness and ancient forest species richness and the non-significance of their ratio in relation to methodological variables suggests that ancient forest species are not particularly rare in the seed bank compared to other species. These results imply that sampling methodology has a far-reaching impact on seed-bank records such as γ-diversity, the detection of ancient forest species and ultimately seed-bank composition. We formulate a set of guidelines to improve the quality of seed-bank studies in temperate deciduous forests.},

	N2 = {This study summarises European research on seed banks in temperate forest systems and analyses for differences in seed bank composition between geographically scattered forests with a different land use history. Special attention is given to seed bank characteristics of ancient forest species. Results of Detrended Correspondence Analysis suggest that historical land use is a key factor in determining the seed bank composition. Particularly seed banks of forests on former heathland sites differ from seed banks of ancient forest due to a high contribution of early successional species. The effect of former land use decreases after 50 yr, due to seed senescence. Total seed density decreases with recent forest age. Seed bank composition of eastern European forests is different from northern or western European forests, a difference which is mainly caused by species with a higher Ellenberg indicator value for continentality, temperature and reaction. In general, ancient forest species are poorly represented. Only a limited number is mentioned to have a persistent seed bank, and their densities are relatively low, which means that restoration of typical ancient forest vegetation can not rely on the seed bank. However, there is still a considerable lack of knowledge concerning seed bank and germination characteristics of forest species.},

A sequential study of the soil seed bank demonstrated seasonal and between-year variability in numbers and composition of the soil seed bank. Soil samples incubated under different temperature and watering regimes produced different communities, indicating that species respond differentially to various environmental combinations. Emergence was extremely low at low water availability and at high temperatures, even in trays with ample water. A high percentage of seeds of four out of five species buried in the field remained viable for two years, while the fifth, Carrichtera annua, showed a sharp decline in seed viability, reaching nearly zero survivorship. Our results indicate that, in this system, annual plant communities result from germination of a fraction of seeds present in the soil seed bank, when autumn or winter rainfalls occur. Because different species have different responses to various combinations of environmental conditions, the community composition varies from year to year. This variability is likely to be a component of coexistence through the storage effect.},

	N2 = {Summary The involvement of four factors (life history, predation, possession of a persistent seed bank and seedling establishment) in the evolution of seed size in flowering plants is discussed. Among herbacaeous plants, biennials seem to have larger seeds than annuals and perennials, a difference which may explain the capacity of some biennials to establish in closed vegetation. In many species, small seeds may have evolved at least partly as a defence against predators. Seeds < 3 mg have some immunity from vertebrate predators but much smaller seeds are consumed by invertebrates. Burial reduces or eliminates most predation by invertebrates. Possession of a persistent seed bank is associated with small, compact, smooth seeds with exacting requirements for germination. Seeds of species which lack seed banks are larger, frequently long or flat, and often have hairs or awns and lax requirements for germination. The evolution of the former group is often intimately connected with the preferences of earthworms. Burial facilitates anchorage of seedlings. In closed herbaceous vegetation, establishment of seedlings seems to be dependent on a low rate of exhaustion of seed reserves achieved by a large seed, low relative growth rate of seedlings or both. In many data sets, seed size and seedling growth rate are negatively correlated, but the generality of the correlation is in doubt. The large seeds of many herbs, shrubs and trees of woodland are suspected to be of critical importance in seedling emergence through tree litter.},

@article{Thompson:1979aa,
	Abstract = {{$[$}(1) Measurements have been made of seasonal variation in the density and composition of the reservoir of germinable seeds present in surface (0-3 cm) soil samples collected at 6-weekly intervals from ten ecologically-contrasted sites in the Sheffield region. (2) The procedure was not designed to provide a complete assessment of the seed flora, and the methods were found to be ineffective in recovering germinable seeds of those species (e.g. Endymion non-scriptus, Viola riviniana, several Umbelliferae) in which there is only a brief interval between fulfilment of a chilling requirement and the onset of germination. (3) The techniques adopted were particularly suitable for the detection of persistent seed banks (i.e. those in which some of the component seeds are at least 1 year old), and also allowed recognition of species in which there is a transient accumulation of detached germinable seeds during the summer. (4) Comparison of the results obtained for populations of the same species in different types of habitat suggests that seasonal variation in seed number is a function of the species rather than of the environment. (5) It is concluded that the major evolutionary force determining the nature of the seed bank is the selective advantage derived from mechanisms of seed dormancy and germination which allow seedlings to evade the potentially-dominating effects of established plants. (6) From the data collected in this study, four types of seed bank (Types I-IV) have been recognized, and an attempt has been made to assess their ecological significance. (7) The transient seed banks (Types I and II) are adapted to exploit the gaps created by seasonally-predictable damage and mortality in the vegetation, whilst the persistent seed bank (Type IV) confers the potential for regeneration in circumstances where disturbance of the established vegetation is temporally and/or spatially unpredictable. A second type of persistent seed bank (Type III) has characteristics intermediate between those of Types I and IV, and contains some seeds which germinate soon after release and others which are more persistent in the soil. (8) A feature of the results was the lack of a general correspondence between the species-composition of the seed flora and that of the associated vegetation. At certain sites, substantial persistent seed banks were detected for species which were either extremely scarce or did not occur at all in the established vegetation. (9) Both transient and persistent types of seed banks were represented at each of the ten sites; this is consistent with the hypothesis that complementary mechanisms of regeneration are involved in the maintenance of floristic diversity.{$]$}},

Although vegetative reproduction is common, replacement does not always occur by vegetative spread; many species appear to be able to replace themselves by seed. Sexual reproductive effort ranges from 1?5 to 50 {\%} among the species reviewed; seed weight averages 2?6 mg. Short dormancy periods (one season) are most common, with germination rates generally below 50{\%}. Mortality rates of small plants are high, but decline as plant size increases. ?Ageing? does not appear to occur. No information exists on population growth rates of temperate deciduous forest herbs, or on the temporal stability of their population sizes or structures. The transition matrix model is suggested as a promising approach to future studies in plant demography.},

Still, our understanding of how environmental drivers shape plant communities is mostly based on above-ground diversity patterns, bypassing below-ground plant diversity stored in seed banks. As seed banks may shape above-ground plant communities, we question whether concurrently analysing the above- and below-ground species assemblages may potentially enhance our understanding of community responses to environmental variation. Location Temperate deciduous forests along a 2000 km latitudinal gradient in NW Europe. Methods Herb layer, seed bank and local environmental data including soil pH, canopy cover, forest cover continuity and time since last canopy disturbance were collected in 129 temperate deciduous forest plots. We quantified herb layer and seed bank diversity per plot and evaluated how environmental variation structured community diversity in the herb layer, seed bank and the combined herb layer?seed bank community. Results Seed banks consistently held more plant species than the herb layer. How local plot diversity was partitioned across the herb layer and seed bank was mediated by environmental variation in drivers serving as proxies of light availability. The herb layer and seed bank contained an ever smaller and ever larger share of local diversity, respectively, as both canopy cover and time since last canopy disturbance decreased. Species richness and ?-diversity of the combined herb layer?seed bank community responded distinctly differently compared to the separate assemblages in response to environmental variation in, e.g. forest cover continuity and canopy cover. Conclusions The seed bank is a below-ground diversity reservoir of the herbaceous forest community, which interacts with the herb layer, although constrained by environmental variation in e.g. light availability. The herb layer and seed bank co-exist as a single community by means of the so-called storage effect, resulting in distinct responses to environmental variation not necessarily recorded in the individual herb layer or seed bank assemblages. Thus, concurrently analysing above- and below-ground diversity will improve our ecological understanding of how understorey plant communities respond to environmental variation.},

In this article I review and synthesize information concerning the herb layer's structure, composition, and dynamics to emphasize its role as an integral component of forest ecosystems. Because species diversity is highest in the herb layer among all forest strata, forest biodiversity is largely a function of the herb-layer community. Competitive interactions within the herb layer can determine the initial success of plants occupying higher strata, including the regeneration of dominant overstory tree species. Furthermore, the herb layer and the overstory can become linked through parallel responses to similar environmental gradients. These relationships between strata vary both spatially and temporally. Because the herb layer responds sensitively to disturbance across broad spatial and temporal scales, its dynamics can provide important information regarding the site characteristics of forests, including patterns of past land-use practices. Thus, the herb layer has a significance that belies its diminutive stature.},

Species may co-occur by shifting timing of growth, or by changing their growth rate to avoid competition for resources, namely light. However, due to the lack of data on growth phenology of a large set of species, we do not know how common each phenomenon is and whether the phenology of coexisting species shows a non-random distribution, which would be indicative of either niche differentiation or resource competition. Location Czech Republic. Methods We recorded growth phenological data of 381 perennial herbaceous species in plant collections in the Botanical Garden of Charles University in Prague, allowing frequent recordings on a large number of species that grow in conditions close to their natural habitats. We used the measurements to derive the day of peak growth and two types of growth rates. We then used co-occurrence data of these species from the Czech National Phytosociological Database and examined whether co-occurring species show non-random patterns of these parameters in 11 individual habitats, which were identified by the European Nature Information System. Results We found large differences among habitat types, partly due to differences in habitat productivity, indicated by the mean height and summed cover of all species in the habitats. Unexpectedly, we did not find temporal niche differentiation in woodlands, indicating the day of peak growth of species was essentially random. Growth rates in forests were strongly over-dispersed. This pattern contrasted with grasslands where the distribution of all parameters showed synchronization, which is likely because plants need to succeed in asymmetric competition for light. Conclusion These data provide the first quantitative assessment of differences in growth dynamics across communities and show one of the first unequivocal demonstrations of trait overdispersion in plant communities.},

	N2 = {Abstract While plant community theory tends to emphasize the importance of abiotic heterogeneity along niche axes, much empirical work seeks to characterize the influence of the absolute magnitude of key abiotic variables on diversity. Both magnitude (as reflected, e.g., by a mean) and heterogeneity (variance) in abiotic conditions likely contribute to biodiversity patterns in plant communities, but given the large number of putative abiotic drivers and the fact that each may vary at different spatiotemporal scales, the challenge of linking observed biotic patterns with the underlying environment remains acute. Using monitoring data from a natural resource agency, we compared how well statistical models of the mean, heterogeneity, and both the mean and heterogeneity combined of 17 abiotic factor variables explained patterns of forb species richness in Northeast Ohio, USA. We performed our analyses at two spatial scales, repeated in spring and summer across four forest types. Although all models explained a great deal of the variance in species richness, models including both the mean and heterogeneity of different abiotic factors together outperformed models including either the mean or the heterogeneity of abiotic factors alone. Variability in forb species richness was mostly due to changes in mean calcium levels regardless of forest type. After accounting for forest type, we were able to attribute variation in forb species richness to changes in the heterogeneity of different abiotic factors as well. Our results suggest that multiple mechanisms act simultaneously according to different aspects of the abiotic environment to structure forb communities, and this underscores the importance of considering both the magnitude of and heterogeneity in multiple abiotic factors when looking for links between the abiotic environment and plant community patterns. Finally, we identify novel patterns across spatial scales, forest types, and seasons that can guide future research in this vein.

Most species had definite elevation optima and could be categorized as either light specialists for high or low light, or light generalists. To test Grime's ideas regarding the existence of three primary plant strategies (competitive, stress tolerant, and ruderal), we used simple autecological indices to classify species into guilds. Higher elevation areas were dominated by tall competitive perennial forbs. As flooding frequency increased, smaller perennial forbs (stress-tolerant competitors) and tall annuals (competitive ruderals) increased in importance. In areas of greatest flooding frequency, the dichotomy in plant strategies was most extreme: slowgrowing, flood-tolerant sedges and grasses (stress tolerators) shared the ground with small, fast-maturing, annual forbs (ruderals). Tolerance to flooding in sedges and grasses may be related to the position of their shoot apex, which affords protection from mechanical damage caused by turbulent flooding. Light was important in differentiating guilds (high light specialists, light generalists, small spring-flowering forbs) only when flooding was infrequent. Grime's triangle of plant strategies maps onto axes of disturbance frequency and physiological tolerance, emphasizing the interaction of environment and adaptation in determining strategy. One environmental event, such as flood, fire, or drought, may be seen as a disturbance by short-lived ruderal species and as a stress by tolerant, long-lived perennials. Combinations of more than one important stress or disturbance further complicate Grime's model.},

However, predicting how these changes affect the structure and long-term dynamics of natural communities is challenging because phenology and coexistence theory have largely proceeded independently. Here, I propose a conceptual framework that incorporates seasonal timing of species interactions into a well-studied competition model to examine how changes in phenologies influence long-term dynamics of natural communities. Using this framework I demonstrate that persistence and coexistence conditions strongly depend on the difference in species? mean phenologies and how this difference varies across years. Consequently, shifts in mean and interannual variation in relative phenologies of species can fundamentally alter the outcome of interactions and the potential for persistence and coexistence of competing species. These effects can be predicted by how per-capita effects scale with differences in species? phenologies. I outline how this approach can be parameterized with empirical systems and discuss how it fits within the context of current coexistence theory. Overall, this synthesis reveals that phenology of species interactions can play a crucial yet currently understudied role in driving coexistence and biodiversity patterns in natural systems and determine how species will respond to future climate change.},
