	Abstract = { The order and timing of species immigration during community assembly can affect species abundances at multiple spatial scales. Known as priority effects, these effects cause historical contingency in the structure and function of communities, resulting in alternative stable states, alternative transient states, or compositional cycles. The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question: How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained? },

	Abstract = {{P>Mathematical models that predict emergence of weed seedbanks could be
   useful tools for determining the most suitable time for weed seedling
   control and, consequently, should result in a higher efficacy of applied
   control methods. To achieve this goal in dormant weed species,
   functional relationships should be established between environmental
   factors regulating dormancy and dormancy changes of seed populations. In
   the present work, we used a simple model and an optimisation procedure
   to quantify the effect of temperature on Polygonum aviculare seed
   dormancy release and induction, based on germination data. Dormancy
   release rate was inversely related to temperature, showing a decreasing
   logistic trend that results in no dormancy release for seeds exposed to
   20 and 25 degrees C. In contrast, dormancy induction rates in absolute
   values were positively associated with temperature, showing a logistic
   trend in which dormancy induction was almost zero at low temperatures
   and maximal at 25 degrees C. Derived model parameters were used to
   simulate dormancy changes of P. aviculare seeds stored under controlled
   and field conditions. These results suggest that similar model
   structures could be used to quantify temperature effects on seed
   dormancy status of other weed species and to develop predictive models
   of weed emergence.}},

@article{Inouye2001,
	Abstract = {{Competition is an important interaction in ecology, and many experiments
   have been done to examine the effects of intraspecific and interspecific
   competition. Unfortunately, most of these experiments have been done
   using either substitution or additive experimental designs. Substitution
   designs, and to a lesser extent additive designs, severely limit the
   useful inferences that ecologists can draw from the resulting data.
   Response surface experimental designs, which vary the densities of two
   competing species independently, offer the advantage of being able to
   compare the fits of alternative competition models and to estimate model
   parameters. This kind of experimental design has been relatively little
   used in ecology to date. I consider the use of response surface designs
   from two perspectives. The first is the optimal allocation of
   experimental effort among density treatments, with the goal of
   distinguishing among alternative models. Second, I compare the ability
   of six response surface designs to estimate known competition
   coefficients correctly, using simulated data. Low densities and
   densities near equilibrium in one generation tend to return similar
   densities the following generation and thus provide little or no
   information for comparing alternative population models. Experimental
   designs that span a wide range of densities, including high densities
   above carrying capacities, provide more accurate parameter estimates in
   general, but low densities are helpful for estimating population growth
   rates. Designs that are not fully factorial are one compromise solution
   that can yield accurate parameter estimates for models and yet require
   less experimental effort than full factorial surfaces. In general,
   response surfaces are a powerful class of experimental design and offer
   potentially stronger connections between empirical and theoretical
   approaches than traditional experimental designs.}},

@article{Connolly2005,
	Abstract = {{A method is proposed for assessing the relative importance of species
   identity, neighbour species influence and environment as determinants of
   change in community biomass composition in two-species short-term
   competition experiments. The method is based on modelling the
   differences in relative growth rates (RGR) of species ( hence called the
   RGRD method). Using a multiple regression approach it quantifies the
   effects of initial species' abundance, species identity and environment
   on RGRD and hence on change in community biomass composition. The RGRD
   approach is relatively simple to use and deals readily with statistical
   difficulties associated with correlated responses between species from
   the same stand. It can be easily adapted to analyse sequential harvest
   data. An example based on data from two-species mixtures of the annual
   species Stellaria media and Poa annua is used to illustrate the method.
   The main determinant of change in community biomass composition was
   species identity, reflected in the difference in growth rates between
   the species. Change in community composition was not, in general,
   significantly affected by the influence of neighbours or fertiliser
   level. The unimportance of the influence of neighbours in affecting the
   composition of these communities contrasts with the strong role of
   intra-and interspecific competition in determining the size of
   individuals of both species (Connolly et al. in Oecologia 82: 513 - 526,
   1990).}},

@article{Axmanova2012,
	Abstract = {Questions: Biomass is an important ecological property, but its measurement is destructive and time-consuming and therefore generally missing for historical vegetation plots. Here we propose and test indirect estimation of herbaceous biomass using models based on easily obtainable variables, namely plant height and cover. We compare these models with Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients (EIVs Nutrients), which are sometimes used as an alternative measure of productivity. Location: Czech Republic, western Slovakia. Methods: Above-ground biomass (dry weight; g\&{\#}xb7;m -2 ) was regressed against the following explanatory variables: (1) Cover E 1 , total percentage cover of the herb layer visually estimated in the field; (2) Biomass estimate-raw, -adjusted and -median, calculated from plant covers and heights (according to a local flora); and (3) mean EIVs Nutrients calculated per plot. For the analyses, we used four data sets containing a total of 469 plots from different vegetation types: 'Wet meadows', 'Dry grasslands', 'Fen\&{\#}x2014;dry grassland transects' and 'Forest herb layer'. To test the applicability of different biomass estimates we chose an example of a species richness\&{\#}x2014;productivity relationship in the 'Wet meadows' data set and describe differences in resulting patterns. Results: Both cover of herb layer and calculated 'biomass volumes' were more accurate in predicting biomass dry weight than EIVs Nutrients. The best results were obtained from the Biomass estimate-median model that combines median stand height and total cover of the herb layer. Cover E 1 showed relatively tight correlations with biomass, particularly in sparse vegetation, but was a rather poor predictor when cover values were high. This was especially noticeable in application of the Cover E 1 model in analysis of the species richness\&{\#}x2014;productivity relationship. Conclusions: In contrast to biomass, cover of the herb layer has a fixed upper limit (100{\%}), which may lead to misinterpretations in dense, structurally diverse vegetation. Most promising is the Biomass estimate-median method, which can be applied both to already sampled plots by calculating median height from average species heights according to local floras and to newly sampled plots using the median of plant heights measured in the field. Therefore, we propose it as a rapid, non-destructive alternative to biomass harvest.},

	Abstract = {{The concept of alternative stable states has long been a dominant
   framework for studying the influence of historical contingency in
   community assembly. This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real
   communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the
   utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states
   remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we
   show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects
   community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient
   states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as
   mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to
   historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also
   show that transient states can last for a long time relative to
   immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a
   conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative
   transient states for understanding historical contingency in community
   assembly.}},

@article{Dickson2012,
	Abstract = {Invasive, non-native plant species often outcompete native species and reduce biodiversity. Invasive plants frequently begin growth before native plants, yet few studies have examined whether invasives win in competition partly by colonizing disturbed sites more quickly or by beginning growth earlier in the season than native plants (i.e. due to priority effects). We hypothesized that invasive plant species would benefit more from priority effects than would comparable native species and that earlier growth of invasive species would decrease plant biodiversity. To test this hypothesis, we grew three pairs of invasive and native plant species from three different functional groups/plant families (C3 grasses/Poaceae, non-leguminous forbs/Asteraceae, and legumes/Fabaceae). We seeded each of the species 3 weeks before seeding the other five species into large pots in a greenhouse. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found much stronger priority effects with invasive than native species. Each invasive species formed a near-monocultures when seeded first (97.5 {\%} of total biomass, on average) whereas native species did not similarly dominate (29.8 {\%} of total biomass, on average). Similarly, Simpson's species diversity was 81 {\%} higher when the initially sown species was native rather than invasive. The literature suggests that invasive species in the field often begin growth earlier in the spring than native species and that climate change may increasingly allow invasives to begin growth before native species, indicating invasive priority effects may become increasingly common.},

@article{Kardol2013,
	Abstract = {{Assembly history, including the order in which species arrive into a
   community, can influence long-term community structure; however we know
   less about how timing of species arrival may alter assembly especially
   under varying resource conditions. To explore how the timing of species
   arrival interacts with resource availability to alter community
   assembly, we constructed experimental plant communities and manipulated
   the interval between plantings of groups of seedlings (0, 5, 10, 15 or
   20 days) at low and high levels of soil nutrient supply. To see if
   community changes influenced ecosystem-scale processes, we measured
   parameters across the plant -soil continuum (e.g. plant biomass and net
   ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange).
   We found that the timing of species arrival had a large impact on
   community assembly, but the size of the effect depended on soil
   fertility. As planting interval increased, plant communities diverged
   further from the control, but the divergence was stronger at high than
   at low nutrient supply. Our data suggest that at high nutrient supply,
   early-planted species preempted light resources more quickly, thus
   preventing the successful establishment of later arriving species even
   at short planting intervals. Finally, we found that assembly related
   divergence in plant communities scaled to impact ecosystem-level
   characteristics such as green leaf chemistry, but had little effect on
   total community biomass and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and water
   vapor. Our data indicate that the effect of a stochastic factor, here
   the timing of species arrival on community composition, depends on the
   resource level under which the community assembles.}},

	Abstract = {{`Who comes first' is decisive for plant community assembly and ecosystem
   properties. Early arrival or faster initial development of a species
   leads to space occupancy both above and below ground and contributes to
   species success. However, regular disturbance (e.g. biomass removal)
   might permit later-arriving or slower-developing species to catch up.
   Here, artificial communities of grassland species belonging to the plant
   functional types (PFTs) herb, grass and legume were used to test the
   effect of stepwise arrival (sowing) of PFTs.
   Dramatic effects were found as a result of a 3 wk arrival difference on
   composition and above-ground biomass that persisted over four harvests
   and two seasons. Priority effects, such as unequal germination time
   (arrival), and thus differences in community age structure, had lasting
   effects on PFT biomass contribution and associated ecosystem
   functioning. These effects were robust against above-ground disturbance.
   Benefits of earlier root formation outweighed above-ground species
   interaction.
   Earlier space occupancy and bigger reserve pools are the likely causes.
   Natural populations commonly exhibit age diversity and asynchrony of
   development among taxa. In experiments, artificial synchrony of arrival
   (sowing) may thus induce assembly routes favouring faster-establishing
   taxa, with consequences for ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity).
   Founder effects, such as those observed here, could be even greater in
   communities of slow-growing species or forests, given their longer
   generation time and minor disturbance.}},

@article{Cleland2015,
	Abstract = {{Exotic species are sometimes phenologically distinct from native species
   in the invaded community, allowing them to be active when there may be
   reduced competition for resources. In southern California, annual
   species are particularly problematic invaders, and prior work has shown
   that these species germinate earlier in the growing season, giving them
   a competitive advantage over later-germinating native species. This
   result begs the question, if being active earlier is advantageous, why
   have not native species adapted earlier cues for germination? We
   hypothesized native species would benefit less from earlier germination
   than exotic species (potentially due to slower growth following
   germination), thus negating potential selection for early germination.
   Here we manipulated planting time for common native and exotic species,
   growing them in all possible species pairs, to evaluate how competitive
   outcomes were altered by the time of arrival and the origin of competing
   species. In contrast to our hypotheses, the exotic species often had
   lower biomass when planted first, potentially due to disturbance when
   the second species was planted. In contrast, three out of our four
   native species benefited from earlier planting (a priority effect).
   Unlike the potential benefit of arriving early, we found no evidence
   that being planted one week later resulted in a competitive
   disadvantage, when compared to being planted simultaneously with a
   competitor. Further, we found that the magnitude and even direction of
   priority effects varied depending on the identity of the interacting
   species. Together these results suggest that a lack of directional
   selection may prevent adaptation towards earlier germination times of
   native species. Although this experiment was conducted with a limited
   suite of species, the results show that the role of seasonal priority
   effects varies among species, and that native species could benefit from
   seasonal priority effects in restoration efforts even when in
   competition with fast-growing exotic annual species.}},

@article{Wainwright2012,
	Abstract = {{1. The timing of seasonal activity (i.e. phenology) may play an
   important role in plant invasions. In ecosystems characterized by
   seasonal rainfall, early-active exotic species may pre-empt resources
   and attain competitive dominance via a seasonal priority advantage.
   Exotic annual grasses in California are often active earlier than native
   species, potentially because they possess greater germination
   plasticity. While these problematic invaders may usually benefit from
   having early phenology, their flexible germination cues might be
   manipulated as a restoration strategy to germinate seeds far in advance
   of favourable growing conditions, leading to a priority disadvantage.
   2. We manipulated the start of the growing season in an invaded
   California coastal sage scrub community characterized by a
   Mediterranean-type climate to (i) identify whether early-season
   phenology confers a performance advantage and (ii) test whether rainfall
   timing could be manipulated to favour native species. We compared the
   performance of seeded native and exotic focal species under ambient
   rainfall timing (winter rains) vs. with a pre-growing season
   (late-summer) watering event.
   3. Under ambient rainfall timing, exotic annual grasses and forbs
   germinated earlier and reached higher levels of abundance than native
   species, consistent with a seasonal priority advantage. Many exotic
   annual grasses germinated with pre-season watering, but none survived
   until the onset of natural rains. Observations suggest that
   early-germinating seedlings suffered mortality via herbivory. The
   watering pulse thus depleted the exotic seedbank, fewer exotic
   individuals germinated with winter rains, and exotic species attained
   lower abundance than under the natural rainfall timing.
   4. Native species, whether annual or perennial, did not germinate with
   the pre-season watering pulse, suggesting they may have more constrained
   germination cues than the exotic species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that phenology is an
   important factor influencing invasion success, and that this could be
   manipulated to favour native species. Manipulation of the start of the
   growing season, for example through a pre-growing season watering event,
   could be a successful restoration strategy for native species in some
   ecosystems.}},

	Abstract = {Abstract Biotic pollination is thought to correlate with increased interspecific competition for pollination among plants and a higher speciation rate. In this study we compared patterns of flowering phenology and species richness between abiotically (wind) and biotically pollinated plants, using phylogenetically independent contrasts. We compiled phenological data from eight local seasonal floras, in which we found geographically overlapping sister clades. Of 65 documented origins of wind pollination, we were able to use up to 17 independent contrasts. In contrast to previous studies we found no difference in global species richness between wind- and biotically pollinated sister clades. Regarding phenology, we found wider phenological spread in biotically pollinated clades, earlier flowering onset in wind-pollinated trees, but no difference in duration of flowering between pollination modes. These results corroborate previous views that niche space is more constrained for wind-pollinated species, and that niche partitioning is less important between wind-pollinated plants compared to plants pollinated by animals.},

	Abstract = {{The effect of moist stratification at cool temperatures on Aesculus
   hippocastanum (horse chestnut) seed dormancy release and subsequent
   thermal time requirement for germination has been investigated.
   Germination performance following over 50 different treatments, each
   varying in time and temperature of stratification and germination to a
   total test time of over 3 yr, was used to develop a predictive model for
   dormancy release and germination.
   Stratification at 2-16degreesC caused a reduction in base (minimum)
   temperature for germination (T-b), being fastest at the colder
   temperatures. Using the sigmoid relationship between rate of reduction
   in T-b and stratification temperature, seed germination can be predicted
   in relation to thermal time accumulation above a gradually reducing T-b.
   Newly shed unstratified seeds, seeds with reduced viability, and seeds
   on the brink of germination because of T-b being close to stratification
   temperature, did not conform to the model.
   T-b is not constant during dormancy release in horse chestnut seeds. A
   reduction in T-b in response to cold stratification may be
   characteristic of summer annuals, suggesting future applications for
   this approach in seed ecology studies.}},

	Abstract = {{A model for simulating Polygonum aviculare L. seed dormancy loss in
   relation to stratification temperature was developed. The model employs
   the lower limit temperature for germination (T-l) as an index of seed
   population dormancy status. While population mean for T-l (T-l(50)) and
   T-l distribution within the population (sigma(Tl)) are allowed to vary
   as seeds are released from dormancy, other thermal parameters
   characterizing the germination thermal responses (base, optimal and
   maximal temperatures, and thermal time required for germination) and the
   higher limit temperature for germination (T-h) are held constant. In
   order to relate changes in T-l(50) and sigma(Tl) to variable time and
   temperature, a stratification thermal time index (S-tt) was developed,
   which consists of the accumulation of thermal time units under a
   threshold temperature for dormancy loss to occur. Therefore, T-l(50) and
   sigma(Tl) varied in relation to the accumulation of S-tt according to
   time and temperature. To derive model equations, changes in seed
   population thermal parameters were estimated for buried seeds stored at
   1.6, 7 and 12degreesC for 110 d. Seeds were exhumed at regular
   intervals, and were incubated at 15degreesC and at a gradually

   Thermal parameters that best fit simulated and experimentally obtained

	Abstract = {{Temperature is a key factor affecting both dormancy and germination. In
   non-dormant seeds, when temperature is within the thermal range
   permissive for germination, it just regulates germination velocity,
   while in seeds presenting dormancy it can also be affecting dormancy
   level, dormancy termination and the expression of dormancy itself. This
   dual effect of temperature on dormancy and germination often leads to
   misinterpretation of obtained germination results and confounds the
   analysis of temperature effects in seed populations presenting some
   degree of dormancy. In the present paper we discuss the effect of
   temperature in the regulation of dormancy level and its implications in
   dormancy expression, as an attempt to construct a conceptual framework
   that allows distinguishing between the effects of temperature on
   dormancy and germination. Finally, we present examples of how a better
   understanding of these effects could help us to interpret the mixed
   effects of temperature on both processes during incubation of seeds
   presenting dormancy.}},

@article{Long2015,
	Abstract = {{Seed persistence is the survival of seeds in the environment once they
   have reached maturity. Seed persistence allows a species, population or
   genotype to survive long after the death of parent plants, thus
   distributing genetic diversity through time. The ability to predict seed
   persistence accurately is critical to inform long-term weed management
   and flora rehabilitation programs, as well as to allow a greater
   understanding of plant community dynamics. Indeed, each of the 420000
   seed-bearing plant species has a unique set of seed characteristics that
   determine its propensity to develop a persistent soil seed bank. The
   duration of seed persistence varies among species and populations, and
   depends on the physical and physiological characteristics of seeds and
   how they are affected by the biotic and abiotic environment. An
   integrated understanding of the ecophysiological mechanisms of seed
   persistence is essential if we are to improve our ability to predict how
   long seeds can survive in soils, both now and under future climatic
   conditions. In this review we present an holistic overview of the seed,
   species, climate, soil, and other site factors that contribute
   mechanistically to seed persistence, incorporating physiological,
   biochemical and ecological perspectives. We focus on current knowledge
   of the seed and species traits that influence seed longevity under ex
   situ controlled storage conditions, and explore how this inherent
   longevity is moderated by changeable biotic and abiotic conditions in
   situ, both before and after seeds are dispersed. We argue that the
   persistence of a given seed population in any environment depends on its
   resistance to exiting the seed bank via germination or death, and on its
   exposure to environmental conditions that are conducive to those fates.
   By synthesising knowledge of how the environment affects seeds to
   determine when and how they leave the soil seed bank into a
   resistance-exposure model, we provide a new framework for developing
   experimental and modelling approaches to predict how long seeds will
   persist in a range of environments.}},

While a superior competitive ability has often been proposed as a major driver of successful plant invasions, its significance depends crucially on the timing of any competitive interaction. We assess whether a mismatch in germination phenology can favor the establishment of alien species, allowing them to exploit vacant niches where competition is low. As well as having important effects on the survival, growth and fitness of a species, asymmetric competition and potential soil legacies resulting from early or late germination can also impact on species recruitment. However, early or late germination comes at a cost, increases the risks of exposure to unfavorable conditions and requires an enhanced abiotic resistance if it is to lead to successful establishment.Important FindingsWhile there are several anecdotal accounts of early and late germination for invasive species, there are limited comparative data with resident species growing under natural conditions. Available evidence from grassland communities indicates that a short-term germination advantage or priority (few days/weeks) provides invasive species with a strong competitive advantage over native species and is a critical factor in many invasions. While the exploitation of periods of low competition is a plausible mechanism for the successful establishment of many invasive plants, direct evidence for this strategy is still scarce. This is particularly true with regard to the exploitation of late germination niches. Consequently, long-term comparative monitoring of the germination phenology of invasive and native plants in situ is needed to assess its significance in a range of ecosystems and its impact on community dynamics.},

   conditions in which the seed is able to germinate. It is determined by
   genetics with a substantial environmental influence which is mediated,
   at least in part, by the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins.
   Not only is the dormancy status influenced by the seed maturation
   environment, it is also continuously changing with time following
   shedding in a manner determined by the ambient environment. As dormancy
   is present throughout the higher plants in all major climatic regions,
   adaptation has resulted in divergent responses to the environment.
   Through this adaptation, germination is timed to avoid unfavourable
   weather for subsequent plant establishment and reproductive growth. In
   this review, we present an integrated view of the evolution, molecular
   genetics, physiology, biochemistry, ecology and modelling of seed
   dormancy mechanisms and their control of germination. We argue that

@article{Walck2011,
	Abstract = {{At the core of plant regeneration, temperature and water supply are
   critical drivers for seed dormancy (initiation, break) and germination.
   Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and
   will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already
   documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and
   vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population
   dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities.
   Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed
   mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted
   changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture,
   will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed
   longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity.
   More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for
   species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit
   their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively
   quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative
   environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in
   understudied ecosystems, on key issues related to seed ecology, and on
   evolution of seed traits in nonweedy species is needed to more fully
   comprehend and plan for plant responses to global warming.}},

   temperatures between 2 degrees C and 42 degrees C exhibited two peaks in
   germination (radicle growth), representing a low temperature (2-8
   degrees C) and a high temperature response (31-36 degrees C),
   Germination at 36 degrees C generally occurred within 1 month of sowing,
   but was never fully expressed in the seedlots investigated. At low
   temperatures (2-8 degrees C), germination started after around 4 months.
   Generally, very low levels of germination were observed at intermediate
   temperatures (11-26 degrees C). Stratification at 6 degrees C prior to
   germination at warmer temperatures increased the proportion of seeds
   that germinated, and the rate of germination for all seedlots. Within a
   harvest, germination percentage (on a probit scale) increased linearly
   with stratification time and this relationship was independent of
   germination temperature (16-36 degrees C), However, inter-seasonal
   differences in the increases in germination capacity following chilling
   were observed, varying from 0.044 to 0.07 probits d(-1) of chilling at 6
   degrees C, Increased sensitivity to chilling was associated with warmer
   temperatures during the period of seed filling. The estimated base
   temperature for germination, T-b for newly harvested seeds varied
   slightly between collection years, but was close to 25 degrees C. For
   all seedlots, T-b decreased by 1 degrees C every 6 d of chilling at 6
   degrees C. This systematic reduction in T-b with chilling ultimately
   facilitated germination at 6 degrees C after dormancy release.}},

@article{Pritchard1996,
	Abstract = {The effects of temperature on dormancy loss, germination and viability were investigated in seeds of Aesculus hippocastanum L. harvested over a 4-year period. Release from embryo dormancy in freshly harvested seeds was manifest in two phases of morphological growth: initially, when the seed lot was only partially released, axis emergence resulted primarily from cotyledonary petiole extension without radicle extension; subsequently, when the seed lot was totally released, axis emergence of all seeds was followed immediately by extension to {$>$}1 cm through growth of the radicle. Germination (axis emergence and radicle extension) at 16$\,^{\circ}$C was a function of pre-treatment period at 2--11$\,^{\circ}$C. The rate of dormancy loss (probit germination d−1) increased linearly below a ceiling temperature for the chilling response; this temperature was estimated to vary from 13$\,^{\circ}$C to 16$\,^{\circ}$C for two seed lots harvested in separate years. Dormancy periods for individual seeds within both seed lot populations can be described by cumulative normal distributions; the predicted standard deviation of chilling units below the ceiling temperature (i.e. thermal time) was 186$\,^{\circ}$C d. Visible germination occurred during the process of stratification at 2$\,^{\circ}$C, starting after 21--25 weeks. By contrast, three years of hy-drated seed storage at 16$\,^{\circ}$C, which was a non-permissive temperature for dormancy loss, resulted in little pre-emergence of the axis during stratification; approximately one third of the seeds remained germinable. The implications of these quantitative analyses of the physiological processes in recalcitrant seeds for the development of improved storage methods are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge and prediction of seasonal weed seedling emergence patterns is useful in weed management programs. Seed dormancy is a major factor influencing the timing of seedling emergence, and once dormancy is broken, environmental conditions determine the rate of germination and seedling emergence. Seed dormancy is a population-based phenomenon, because individual seeds are independently sensing their environment and responding physiologically to the signals they perceive. Mathematical models based on characterizing the variation that occurs in germination times among individual seeds in a population can describe and quantify environmental and after-ripening effects on seed dormancy. In particular, the hydrothermal time model can describe and quantify the effects of temperature and water potential on seed germination. This model states that the time to germination of a given seed fraction is inversely proportional to the amount by which a given germination factor (e.g., temperature or water potential) exceeds a threshold level for that factor. The hydrothermal time model provides a robust method for understanding how environmental factors interact to result in the germination phenotype (i.e., germination pattern over time) of a seed population. In addition, other factors that influence seed dormancy and germination act by causing the water potential thresholds of the seed population to shift to higher or lower values. This relatively simple model can describe and quantify the germination behavior of seeds across a wide array of environmental conditions and dormancy states, and can be used as an input to more general models of seed germination and seedling emergence in the field.},

@article{Meyer2000,
	Abstract = {{Hydrothermal time (HTT) describes progress toward seed germination under
   various combinations of incubation water potential (Psi) and temperature
   (T). To examine changes in HTT parameters during dormancy loss, seeds
   from two populations of the bunchgrass Elymus elymoides were incubated
   under seven temperature regimes following dry storage at 10, 20 and 30
   degreesC for intervals from 0 to 16 weeks. Fully after-ripened seeds
   were primed for 1 week at a range of Psis. Data on germination rate
   during priming were used to obtain a HTT equation for each seed
   population, while data obtained following transfer to water were used to
   calculate HTT accumulation during priming. HTT equations accurately
   predicted germination time course curves if mean base water potential,
   Psi (b)(50), was allowed to vary with temperature. Psi (b)(50) values
   increased linearly with temperature, explaining why germination rate
   does not increase with temperature in this species. Psi (b)(50) showed a
   linear decrease as a function of thermal time in storage. Slopes for the
   T x Psi (b)(50) relationship did not change during after-ripening. This
   thermal after-ripening time model was characterized by a single base
   temperature and a constant slope across temperatures for each
   collection. Because the difference between initial and final Psi
   (b)(50)s was uniform across temperatures, the thermal after-ripening
   requirement was also a constant. When seeds were primed for 1 week at -4
   to -20 MPa, accumulation of HTT was a uniform 20\% of the total HTT
   requirement. When primed at 0 to -4 MPa, HTT accumulation decreased
   linearly with decreasing priming potential, and a hydrothermal priming
   time model using a constant minimum priming potential adequately
   described priming effects. Use of these simple HTT relationships will
   facilitate modelling of germination phenology in the field.}},

@article{Chuine2002,
	Abstract = {Classical budburst models (Spring Warming, Sequential, Parallel and Alternating) are unable to fully predict external data, partly because of the methods of optimization used to adjust them. The purpose of this study was to examine different assumptions of budburst models and select those which are best supported by the data, defining new models able to predict external data. Eight models, each differing in one assumption, were fitted and tested using external data. The dataset used to test the models was deduced from aeropalynological data at two stations in France. The results show that some of the models proposed are able to accurately predict external dates of flowering of most of the studied species. The assumptions of those models have been individually tested and shown to improve the models accuracy. Robust estimates of the best predictor models of 12 tree species are presented. The analysis of hypothetical provenance transfer of two species, Buxus sempervirens and Platanus acerifolia, between the two study sites, shows that P. acerifolia estimates are similar in both environments whereas B. sempervirens estimates are variable. This result, which agrees with the genetic characteristics of both species, shows that local adaptation of phenology can also be studied through modelling approaches.},

	Abstract = {{This review focuses mainly on eudicot seeds, and on the interactions
   between abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins (GA), ethylene,
   brassinosteroids (BR), auxin and cytokinins in regulating the
   interconnected molecular processes that control dormancy release and
   germination. Signal transduction pathways, mediated by environmental and
   hormonal signals, regulate gene expression in seeds. Seed dormancy
   release and germination of species with coat dormancy is determined by
   the balance of forces between the growth potential of the embryo and the
   constraint exerted by the covering layers, e.g. testa and endosperm.
   Recent progress in the field of seed biology has been greatly aided by
   molecular approaches utilizing mutant and transgenic seeds of
   Arabidopsis thaliana and the Solanaceae model systems, tomato and
   tobacco, which are altered in hormone biology. ABA is a positive
   regulator of dormancy induction and most likely also maintenance, while
   it is a negative regulator of germination. GA releases dormancy,
   promotes germination and counteracts ABA effects. Ethylene and BR
   promote seed germination and also counteract ABA effects. We present an
   integrated view of the molecular genetics, physiology and biochemistry
   used to unravel how hormones control seed dormancy release and

	Abstract = {Summary While much research has focused on the timing of individual plant phenological events, the sequence of phenological events has received considerably less attention. Here we identify drivers and patterns of flower and leaf emergence sequence (FLS) in deciduous tree species of the Great Lakes region of North America. Five hypotheses related to cold tolerance, water dynamics, seed mass, pollination syndrome, and xylem anatomy type were compared for their ability to explain FLS. Phylogenetic and geographic patterns of FLS were also assessed. We identified additional traits associated with FLS using Random Forest models. Of the hypotheses assessed, those related to species' water dynamics and seed mass had the greatest support. The spatial pattern of FLS was found to be strongly related to minimum monthly temperature and the phylogenetic pattern was clustered among species. Based on results from Random Forest models, species' fruiting characteristics were found to be the most important variables in explaining FLS. Our results show that FLS is related to a suite of plant traits and environmental tolerances. We emphasize the need to expand phenological research to include both the timing and sequence of plant's entire phenology, in particular in relation to plant physiology and global change.},

	N2 = {BackgroundThe rich literature that characterizes the field of pollination biology has focused largely on animal-pollinated plants. At least 10 {\%} of angiosperms are wind pollinated, and this mode of pollination has evolved on multiple occasions among unrelated lineages, and hence this discrepancy in research interest is surprising. Here, the evolution and functional ecology of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants are discussed, a theoretical framework for modelling the selection of wind pollination is outlined, and pollen capture and the occurrence of pollen limitation in diverse wind-pollinated herbs are investigated experimentally.Scope and ConclusionsWind pollination may commonly evolve to provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. Evidence is presented that pollen limitation in wind-pollinated plants may not be as common as it is in animal-pollinated species. The studies of pollen capture in wind-pollinated herbs demonstrate that pollen transfer efficiency is not substantially lower than in animal-pollinated plants as is often assumed. These findings challenge the explanation that the evolution of few ovules in wind-pollinated flowers is associated with low pollen loads. Floral and inflorescence architecture is crucial to pollination and mating because of the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Evidence is provided for the importance of plant height, floral position, and stamen and stigma characteristics in promoting effective pollen dispersal and capture. Finally, it is proposed that geitonogamous selfing may alleviate pollen limitation in many wind-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers.},

@article{Whitehead1969,
	Abstract = {Studies of the aerodynamics of particle transport and capture suggest that the conditions most propitious for effective wind pollination are as follows: (1) production and release of large numbers of grains; (2) both anthers and stigma exposed; (3) grains falling within a certain size range (20-40\&{\#}x3bc;); very small grains will be dispersed readily but cannot be captured efficiently by the stigma, large grains have a high terminal velocity, hence will settle too rapidly; (4) exine of grains thin (or with large air spaces), sculpture smooth; (5) the stigma should present much surface area to capture grains, but, since collection efficiency will decrease with increasing stigma diameter, the increase in surface should be accomplished through the evolution of a complex stigma with many branches of small diameter; (6) individuals of the species should not be too widely spaced in the vegetation; (7) the vegetation should be open in structure or deciduous; thus there will be few obstructions to transport during at least one portion of the year; (8) flowering must be closely coordinated by relatively unambiguous environmental stimuli; (9) pollen release (hence flowering) should coincide with the most favorable time of the year for transport (low probability of precipitation, adequate winds and turbulence, deciduous season). The geography of wind pollination in the angiosperms can be understood best in terms of these prerequisites for efficient transport of pollen. Anemophily is very infrequent in the tropical rain forest, becomes more frequent as one moves to more seasonally variable environments, and is frequent in northern temperate forests. The environment of the tropical rain forest is unsuitable for anemophily: (1) species diversity is very high, hence individuals of the same species are apt to be widely spaced; (2) the forest is densely structured, hence wind velocities are low and there are many obstacles to transport; (3) there is no leafless season; (4) rainfall is frequent throughout the year, hence transport will be limited; (5) there are few unambiguous stimuli which can coordinate flowering; (6) potential animal pollinators are abundant. These conditions do not exist in northern temperate forests, or in prairies, or in savannas. It is possible that the evolution of wind pollination in the angiosperms paralleled the evolution of the deciduous habit. Axelrod has suggested that the deciduous habit evolved in response to seasonal drought as angiosperms migrated into lower middle latitudes during the early Cretaceous. Both the deciduous habit and the physical conditions existing just peripheral to the tropics would favor the evolution of wind pollination. An examination of seasonal environments in the tropics at present and the fossil record of deciduous and wind pollinated angiosperms supports this contention.},

@article{Vitasse2010,
	Abstract = {{Phenological events, such as the initiation and the end of seasonal
   growth, are thought to be under strong evolutionary control because of
   their influence on tree fitness. Although numerous studies highlighted
   genetic differentiation in phenology among populations from contrasting
   climates, it remains unclear whether local adaptation could restrict
   phenological plasticity in response to current warming. Seedling
   populations of seven deciduous tree species from high and low elevations
   in the Swiss Alps were investigated in eight common gardens located
   along two elevational gradients from 400 to 1,700 m. We addressed the
   following questions: are there genetic differentiations in phenology
   between populations from low and high elevations, and are populations
   from the upper elevational limit of a species' distribution able to
   respond to increasing temperature to the same extent as low-elevation
   populations? Genetic variation of leaf unfolding date between seedlings
   from low and high populations was detected in six out of seven tree
   species. Except for beech, populations from high elevations tended to
   flush later than populations from low elevations, emphasizing that
   phenology is likely to be under evolutionary pressure. Furthermore,
   seedlings from high elevation exhibited lower phenological plasticity to
   temperature than low-elevation provenances. This difference in
   phenological plasticity may reflect the opposing selective forces
   involved (i.e. a trade-off between maximizing growing season length and
   avoiding frost damages). Nevertheless, environmental effects were much
   stronger than genetic effects, suggesting a high phenological plasticity

@article{Visser2010,
	Abstract = {{Phenology refers to the periodic appearance of life-cycle events and
   currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on
   phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these
   events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But
   phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own
   perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing
   and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the
   periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing
   programmes (e. g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes
   underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need
   to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In
   order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate
   these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary
   and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize
   different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already
   been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting
   the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to
   better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change
   impacts on phenology.}},

	Abstract = {Phenology affects nearly all aspects of ecology and evolution. Virtually all biological phenomena{\textemdash}from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes{\textemdash}have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.},

@article{Leverett2017,
	Abstract = {{A single plant can interact both positively and negatively with its
   neighbors through the processes of facilitation and competition,
   respectively. Much of the variation in the balance of facilitation and
   competition that individuals experience can be explained by the degree
   of physical stress and the sizes or ages of plants during the
   interaction. Germination phenology partly controls both of these
   factors, but its role in defining the facilitation-competition balance
   has not been explicitly considered. I performed an experiment in a
   population of the winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) to
   test whether germinating during physically stressful periods leads to
   facilitation while germinating during periods that promote growth and
   reproduction leads to competition. I manipulated germination and
   neighbor presence across two years in order to quantify the effects of
   the local plant community on survival, fecundity, and total fitness as a
   function of germination phenology. Neighbors increased survival when
   germination occurred under conditions that were unsuitable for survival,
   but they reduced fecundity in germinants that were otherwise the most
   fecund. Later germination was associated with facilitation in the first
   year but competition in the second year. These episodes of facilitation
   and competition opposed each other, leading to no net effect of
   neighbors when averaged over all cohorts. These results indicate that
   variation in germination timing can explain some of the variation in the
   facilitation-competition balance in plant communities.}},

	Abstract = {{Climate change is altering the phenology of many species and the timing
   of their interactions with other species, but the impacts of these
   phenological shifts on species interactions remain unclear. Classical
   approaches to the study of phenology have typically documented changes
   in the timing of single life-history events, while phenological shifts
   affect many interactions over entire life histories. In this study, we
   suggest an approach that integrates the phenology and ontogeny of
   species interactions with a fitness landscape to provide a common
   mechanistic framework for investigating phenological shifts. We suggest
   that this ontogeny-phenology landscape provides a flexible method to
   document changes in the relative phenologies of interacting species,
   examine the causes of these phenological shifts, and estimate their
   consequences for interacting species.

	Abstract = {Climate change may disrupt interspecies phenological synchrony, with adverse consequences to ecosystem functioning. We present here a 40-y-long time series on 10,425 dates that were systematically collected in a single Russian locality for 97 plant, 78 bird, 10 herptile, 19 insect, and 9 fungal phenological events, as well as for 77 climatic events related to temperature, precipitation, snow, ice, and frost. We show that species are shifting their phenologies at dissimilar rates, partly because they respond to different climatic factors, which in turn are shifting at dissimilar rates. Plants have advanced their spring phenology even faster than average temperature has increased, whereas migratory birds have shown more divergent responses and shifted, on average, less than plants. Phenological events of birds and insects were mainly triggered by climate cues (variation in temperature and snow and ice cover) occurring over the course of short periods, whereas many plants, herptiles, and fungi were affected by long-term climatic averages. Year-to-year variation in plants, herptiles, and insects showed a high degree of synchrony, whereas the phenological timing of fungi did not correlate with any other taxonomic group. In many cases, species that are synchronous in their year-to-year dynamics have also shifted in congruence, suggesting that climate change may have disrupted phenological synchrony less than has been previously assumed. Our results illustrate how a multidimensional change in the physical environment has translated into a community-level change in phenology.},

@article{Cleland2012,
	Abstract = {Earlier spring phenology observed in many plant species in recent decades provides compelling evidence that species are already responding to the rising global temperatures associated with anthropogenic climate change. There is great variability among species, however, in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. Species that do not phenologically ``track'' climate change may be at a disadvantage if their growth becomes limited by missed interactions with mutualists, or a shorter growing season relative to earlier-active competitors. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that phenological sensitivity could be used to predict species performance in a warming climate, by synthesizing results across terrestrial warming experiments. We assembled data for 57 species across 24 studies where flowering or vegetative phenology was matched with a measure of species performance. Performance metrics included biomass, percent cover, number of flowers, or individual growth. We found that species that advanced their phenology with warming also increased their performance, whereas those that did not advance tended to decline in performance with warming. This indicates that species that cannot phenologically ``track'' climate may be at increased risk with future climate change, and it suggests that phenological monitoring may provide an important tool for setting future conservation priorities.},

	Abstract = {{Global warming is expected to have a major impact on plant
   distributions, an issue of key importance in biological conservation.
   However, very few models are able to predict species distribution
   accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate
   change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree
   species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological
   processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as
   a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power
   when tested against present distributions of two North American species
   - quaking aspen and sugar maple - indicating that on a broad scale, the
   fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche.
   Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range
   and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global
   warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.}},

@article{Menzel2006,
	Abstract = {{Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical
   and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a
   consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators
   is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded
   dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus,
   numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events
   for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season.
   However, published single-site or single-species studies are
   particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly
   reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or
   meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for
   changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We
   used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than
   125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21
   European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all
   leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly)
   and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf
   colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published
   results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or
   publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5
   days decade(-1) in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series
   undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to
   temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by
   2.5 days degrees C(-1), delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day
   degrees C(-1)). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently
   matches measured national warming across 19 European countries
   (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P < 0.001).}},

@article{Piao2007,
	Abstract = {A number of studies have suggested that the growing season duration has significantly lengthened during the past decades, but the connections between phenology variability and the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are far from clear. In this study, we used the ``ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems'' (ORCHIDEE) process based ecosystem model together with observed climate data to investigate spatiotemporal changes in phenology and their impacts on carbon fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere (>25$\,^{\circ}$N) during 1980--2002. We found that the growing season length (GSL) has increased by 0.30 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.27, P = 0.010), owing to the combination of an earlier onset in spring (0.16 days yr−1) and a later termination in autumn (0.14 days yr−1). Trends in the GSL are however highly variable across the regions. In Eurasia, there is a significant trend toward earlier vegetation green-up with an overall advancement rate of 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.005), while in North America there is a significantly delayed vegetation senescence by 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.013) during the study period. Our results also suggested that the GSL strongly correlates with annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP), indicating that longer growing seasons may eventually enhance vegetation growth. A 1-day extension in GSL leads to an increase in annual GPP of 5.8 gC m−2 yr−1 (or 0.6\% per day), and an increase in NPP of 2.8 gC m−2 yr−1 per day. However, owing to enhanced soil carbon decomposition accompanying the GPP increase, a change in GSL correlates only poorly with a change in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP).},
