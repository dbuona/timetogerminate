Abstract = {{Evolution may be dominated by biotic factors, as in the Red Queen model,
   or abiotic factors, as in the Court Jester model, or a mixture of both.
   The two models appear to operate predominantly over different geographic
   and temporal scales: Competition, predation, and other biotic factors
   shape ecosystems locally and over short time spans, but extrinsic
   factors such as climate and oceanographic and tectonic events shape
   larger- scale patterns regionally and globally, and through thousands
   and millions of years. Paleobiological studies suggest that species
   diversity is driven largely by abiotic factors such as climate,
   landscape, or food supply, and comparative phylogenetic approaches offer
   new insights into clade dynamics.}},
