	Abstract = {Tropical ectotherms are considered especially vulnerable to climate change because they have narrow thermal tolerance ranges, such that even small increases in environmental temperature are likely to be detrimental. Although evolutionary adaptation may prevent extinction, it is unclear whether climate change generates selection on thermal physiology in nature or whether the strength of this selection is sufficient for rapid evolution to occur. When we transplanted lizards from their preferred habitat to a warmer and more thermally variable site, strong natural selection favored individuals that ran faster at warmer temperatures and across a broader range of temperatures. If thermal performance traits are heritable, some tropical species may be capable of rapid evolutionary adaptation to changing climates.Tropical ectotherms are thought to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they are adapted to relatively stable temperature regimes, such that even small increases in environmental temperature may lead to large decreases in physiological performance. One way in which tropical organisms may mitigate the detrimental effects of warming is through evolutionary change in thermal physiology. The speed and magnitude of this response depend, in part, on the strength of climate-driven selection. However, many ectotherms use behavioral adjustments to maintain preferred body temperatures in the face of environmental variation. These behaviors may shelter individuals from natural selection, preventing evolutionary adaptation to changing conditions. Here, we mimic the effects of climate change by experimentally transplanting a population of Anolis sagrei lizards to a novel thermal environment. Transplanted lizards experienced warmer and more thermally variable conditions, which resulted in strong directional selection on thermal performance traits. These same traits were not under selection in a reference population studied in a less thermally stressful environment. Our results indicate that climate change can exert strong natural selection on tropical ectotherms, despite their ability to thermoregulate behaviorally. To the extent that thermal performance traits are heritable, populations may be capable of rapid adaptation to anthropogenic warming.},

	Abstract = {{Many ecosystems are rapidly being transformed into new, non-historical
   configurations owing to a variety of local and global changes. We
   discuss how new systems can arise in the face of primarily biotic change
   (extinction and/or invasion), primarily abiotic change (e.g. land use or
   climate change) and a combination of both. Some changes will result in
   hybrid systems retaining some original characteristics as well as novel
   elements, whereas larger changes will result in novel systems, which
   comprise different species, interactions and functions. We suggest that
   these novel systems will require significant revision of conservation
   and restoration norms and practices away from the traditional
   place-based focus on existing or historical assemblages.}},

	Abstract = {{Comparing the magnitude of the current biodiversity crisis with those in
   the fossil record is difficult without an understanding of differential
   preservation. Integrating data from palaeontological databases with
   information on IUCN status, ecology and life history characteristics of
   contemporary mammals, we demonstrate that only a small and biased
   fraction of threatened species (< 9\%) have a fossil record, compared
   with 20\% of non-threatened species. We find strong taphonomic biases
   related to body size and geographic range. Modern species with a fossil
   record tend to be large and widespread and were described in the 19th
   century. The expected magnitude of the current extinction based only on
   species with a fossil record is about half of that of one based on all
   modern species; values for genera are similar. The record of ancient
   extinctions may be similarly biased, with many species having originated
   and gone extinct without leaving a tangible record.}},

   into the ecological mechanisms controlling the cycling and storage of
   carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to our ability to

   that initially guided the design and longevity of forested FACE
   experiments. Net primary productivity is increased by elevated CO2, but
   the response can diminish over time. Carbon accumulation is driven by
   the distribution of carbon among plant and soil components with
   differing turnover rates and by interactions between the carbon and
   nitrogen cycles. Plant community structure may change, but elevated CO2
   has only minor effects on microbial community structure. FACE results
   provide a strong foundation for next-generation experiments in

@article{Vitousek_1997,
	Abstract = {{Nitrogen is a key element controlling the species composition,
   diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater,
   and marine ecosystems. Many of the original plant species living in
   these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and
   solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics
   of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also
   are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other
   human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially,
   generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over
   large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most
   deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads
   regionally and even globally, Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N
   themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen
   inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their
   environmental consequences are serious and long term.
   Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain
   that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have:
   1) approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial
   nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing;
   2) increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N2O globally,
   and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the
   formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth;
   3) caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that
   are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility;
   4) contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and
   lakes in several regions; and
   5) greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to
   estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review of
   available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of
   the nitrogen cycle have:
   6) increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial
   ecosystems;
   7) accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of
   plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals
   and microorganisms that depend on them; and
   8) caused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and
   nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal
   marine fisheries.}},

@article{McGuire_2016,
	Abstract = {Many plants and animals will need to move large distances to track preferred climates, but fragmentation and barriers limit their movements. We asked to what degree and where species will be able to track suitable climates. We demonstrate that only 41\% of US natural land area is currently connected enough to allow species to track preferred temperatures as the planet warms over the next 100 years. If corridors allowed movement between all natural areas, species living in 65\% of natural area could track their current climates, allowing them to adjust to 2.7 {\textdegree}C more temperature change. The greatest benefits result from connecting low-lying natural areas, especially in the southeastern United States. Facilitating movement will be crucial for preventing biodiversity losses.The contiguous United States contains a disconnected patchwork of natural lands. This fragmentation by human activities limits species{\textquoteright} ability to track suitable climates as they rapidly shift. However, most models that project species movement needs have not examined where fragmentation will limit those movements. Here, we quantify climate connectivity, the capacity of landscape configuration to allow species movement in the face of dynamically shifting climate. Using this metric, we assess to what extent habitat fragmentation will limit species movements in response to climate change. We then evaluate how creating corridors to promote climate connectivity could potentially mitigate these restrictions, and we assess where strategies to increase connectivity will be most beneficial. By analyzing fragmentation patterns across the contiguous United States, we demonstrate that only 41\% of natural land area retains enough connectivity to allow plants and animals to maintain climatic parity as the climate warms. In the eastern United States, less than 2\% of natural area is sufficiently connected. Introducing corridors to facilitate movement through human-dominated regions increases the percentage of climatically connected natural area to 65\%, with the most impactful gains in low-elevation regions, particularly in the southeastern United States. These climate connectivity analyses allow ecologists and conservation practitioners to determine the most effective regions for increasing connectivity. More importantly, our findings demonstrate that increasing climate connectivity is critical for allowing species to track rapidly changing climates, reconfiguring habitats to promote access to suitable climates.},

	Abstract = {{This article examines the rise in militarized approaches towards
   conservation, as part of a new `war for biodiversity'. This is a
   defining moment in the international politics of conservation and needs
   further examination. The claims that rhinos and elephants are under
   threat from highly organized criminal gangs of poachers shapes and
   determines conservation practice on the ground. Indeed, a central focus
   of the 2014 London Declaration on the Illegal Wildlife Trade is the
   strengthening of law enforcement, and recent policy statements by the US
   government and the Clinton Global Initiative also draw the link between
   poaching, global security and the need for greater levels of
   enforcement. Such statements and initiatives contribute substantially to
   the growing sense of a war for biodiversity. This article offers a
   critique of that argument, essentially by asking how we define poachers,
   and if militarized approaches mean conservationists are becoming more
   willing to engage in coercive, repressive policies that are ultimately
   counterproductive. Further, this article examines how the new war for
   biodiversity is justified and promoted by referring to wider debates
   about intervention in a post-Cold War era; notably that the
   international community has a responsibility towards wildlife,
   especially endangered species, and that military forms of intervention
   may be required to save them.}},

	Abstract = {Summary *   An experiment with synthesized grassland communities was performed to identify plant traits that contribute to invasiveness and community traits that promote invasibility, and to study the relationship between, and the relative importance of, invasiveness and invasibility. *   Eight perennial grass species were used both as invasible monocultures and as potential invaders in gaps in these monocultures. Invasion success in the establishment phase, and invader and monoculture traits were assessed. *   Invasion success expressed as germination correlated significantly with germination time (invader trait), light penetration in the gaps and N acquisition by the edge plants (monoculture traits). Success expressed as leaf length correlated with seed mass, germination time (invader traits) and light penetration. Forty-six per cent of the variation in germination was explained by invader identity and 8\% by monoculture identity, whereas, for leaf length, they explained 15\% and 18\%, respectively. *   Regenerative traits (seed mass and germination time) correlated with invasiveness, and resource availability (light and nitrogen) with invasibility. The results suggest that species characteristics would largely determine the extent of an invasion event (number of seedlings), while the success of individual invaders (growth and survival) is determined by both species and ecosystem characteristics.},

   studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal
   shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However,
   individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting
   that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal

@article{Gorton_2018,
	Abstract = {A full understanding of how cities shape adaptation requires characterizing genetically-based phenotypic and fitness differences between urban and rural populations under field conditions. We used a reciprocal transplant experiment with the native plant common ragweed, (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), and found that urban and rural populations have diverged in flowering time, a trait that strongly affects fitness. Although urban populations flowered earlier than rural populations, plants growing in urban field sites flowered later than plants in rural field sites. This counter-gradient variation is consistent adaptive divergence between urban and rural populations. Also consistent with local adaptation, both urban and rural genotypes experienced stronger net selection in the foreign than in the local habitat, but this pattern was not significant for male fitness. Despite the evidence for local adaptation, rural populations had higher lifetime fitness at all sites, suggesting that selection has been stronger or more uniform in rural than urban populations. We also found that inter-population differences in both flowering time and fitness tended to be greater among urban than rural populations, which is consistent with greater drift or spatial variation in selection within urban environments. In summary, our results are consistent with adaptive divergence of urban and rural populations, but also suggest there may be greater environmental heterogeneity in urban environments which also affects evolution in urban landscapes.},

@article{Reusch_2007,
	Abstract = {{Global environmental change is altering the selection regime for all
   biota. The key selective factors are altered mean, variance and
   seasonality of climatic variables and increase in CO2 concentration
   itself. We review recent studies that document rapid evolution to global
   climate change at the phenotypic and genetic level, as a response to
   shifts in these factors. Among the traits that have changed are
   photoperiod responses, stress tolerance and traits associated with
   enhanced dispersal. The genetic basis of two traits with a critical role
   under climate change, stress tolerance and photoperiod behaviour, is
   beginning to be understood for model organisms, providing a starting
   point for candidate gene approaches in targeted nonmodel species. Most
   studies that have documented evolutionary change are correlative, while
   selection experiments that manipulate relevant variables are rare. The
   latter are particularly valuable for prediction because they provide
   insight into heritable change to simulated future conditions. An
   important gap is that experimental selection regimes have mostly been
   testing one variable at a time, while synergistic interactions are
   likely under global change. The expanding toolbox available to molecular
   ecologists holds great promise for identifying the genetic basis of many
   more traits relevant to fitness under global change. Such knowledge, in
   turn, will significantly advance predictions on global change effects
   because presence and polymorphism of critical genes can be directly
   assessed. Moreover, knowledge of the genetic architecture of trait
   correlations will provide the necessary framework for understanding
   limits to phenotypic evolution; in particular as lack of critical gene
   polymorphism or entire pathways, metabolic costs of tolerance and
   linkage or pleiotropy causing negative trait correlations. Synergism
   among stressor impacts on organismal function may be causally related to
   conflict among transcriptomic syndromes specific to stressor types.
   Because adaptation to changing environment is always contingent upon the
   spatial distribution of genetic variation, high-resolution estimates of
   gene flow and hybridization should be used to inform predictions of
   evolutionary rates.}},

@article{Cheung_2010,
	Abstract = {Abstract Previous projection of climate change impacts on global food supply focuses solely on production from terrestrial biomes, ignoring the large contribution of animal protein from marine capture fisheries. Here, we project changes in global catch potential for 1066 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an average of 30--70\% increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40\% in the tropics. Moreover, maximum catch potential declines considerably in the southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward tips of continental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regions in terms of their total landings, EEZ regions with the highest increase in catch potential by 2055 include Norway, Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the contrary, EEZ regions with the biggest loss in maximum catch potential include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management options under climate change.},

	Abstract = {Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

	Abstract = {In response to large, severe wildfires in historically fire-adapted forests in the western US, policy initiatives, such as the USDA Forest Service's Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP), seek to increase the pace and scale of ecological restoration. One required component of this program is collaborative adaptive management, in which monitoring data are used to iteratively evaluate and improve future management actions. Here, we assess the success of seven CFLRP treatments, implemented on 2,300 ha during the first three years of the Colorado Front Range Landscape Restoration Initiative (LRI) at achieving desired forest structure by comparing pre- and post-treatment conditions. We also compare post-treatment conditions with reconstructions of historical (ca. 1860) forest conditions to contextualize the magnitude of treatment effects. Restoration projects moved stands toward desired conditions by reducing basal area, tree density, and canopy cover and increasing average tree diameter, large gap cover, and abundance of small- to medium-sized tree groups. Post-treatment stands were similar to historical stands with respect to basal area of ponderosa pine; however, they had higher total tree density and fewer gaps than historical reference conditions, suggesting that restoration prescriptions may be improved with increased flexibility for density reduction of Douglas-fir and increased gap creation. This examination of early CFLRP treatment outcomes as they relate to desired conditions informs potential areas of adjustments to future treatments and provides baseline data to evaluate the evolution of treatments over the program's lifespan. We also identify and discuss several scientific, social, and logistical constraints to large-scale restoration success and make several recommendations to improve restoration outcomes.},

	Abstract = {{There is an increasing consensus that global climate change occurs and
   that potential changes in climate are likely to have important regional
   consequences for biota and ecosystems. Ecological restoration, including
   (re)afforestation and rehabilitation of degraded land, is included in
   the array of potential human responses to climate change. However, the
   implications of climate change for the broader practice of ecological
   restoration must be considered. In particular, the usefulness of
   historical eco-system conditions as targets and references must be set
   against the likelihood that restoring these historic ecosystems is
   unlikely to be easy, or even possible, in the changed biophysical
   conditions of the future. We suggest that more consideration and debate
   needs to be directed at the implications of climate change for
   restoration practice.}},

	N2 = {Abstract:? Conservation should benefit ecosystems, nonhuman organisms, and current and future human beings. Nevertheless, tension among these goals engenders potential ethical conflicts: conservationists' true motivations may differ from the justifications they offer for their activities, and conservation projects have the potential to disempower and oppress people. We reviewed the promise and deficiencies of integrating social, economic, and biological concerns into conservation, focusing on research in ecosystem services and efforts in community-based conservation. Despite much progress, neither paradigm provides a silver bullet for conservation's most pressing problems, and both require additional thought and modification to become maximally effective. We conclude that the following strategies are needed to make conservation more effective in our human-dominated world. (1) Conservation research needs to integrate with social scholarship in a more sophisticated manner. (2) Conservation must be informed by a detailed understanding of the spatial, temporal, and social distributions of costs and benefits of conservation efforts. Strategies should reflect this understanding, particularly by equitably distributing conservation's costs. (3) We must better acknowledge the social concerns that accompany biodiversity conservation; accordingly, sometimes we must argue for conservation for biodiversity's sake, not for its direct human benefits.},

	Abstract = {{The first public product of the Intergovernmental Platform on
   Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is its Conceptual Framework.
   This conceptual and analytical tool, presented here in detail, will
   underpin all IPBES functions and provide structure and comparability to
   the syntheses that IPBES will produce at different spatial scales, on
   different themes, and in different regions. Salient innovative aspects
   of the IPBES Conceptual Framework are its transparent and participatory
   construction process and its explicit consideration of diverse
   scientific disciplines, stakeholders, and knowledge systems, including
   indigenous and local knowledge. Because the focus on co-construction of
   integrative knowledge is shared by an increasing number of initiatives
   worldwide, this framework should be useful beyond IPBES, for the wider
   research and knowledge-policy communities working on the links between
   nature and people, such as natural, social and engineering scientists,
   policy-makers at different levels, and decision-makers in different
   sectors of society.}},

	Abstract = {{As urbanisation increases globally and the natural environment becomes
   increasingly fragmented, the importance of urban green spaces for
   biodiversity conservation grows. In many countries, private gardens are
   a major component of urban green space and can provide considerable
   biodiversity benefits. Gardens and adjacent habitats form interconnected
   networks and a landscape ecology framework is necessary to understand
   the relationship between the spatial configuration of garden patches and
   their constituent biodiversity. A scale-dependent tension is apparent in
   garden management, whereby the individual garden is much smaller than
   the unit of management needed to retain viable populations. To overcome
   this, here we suggest mechanisms for encouraging `wildlife-friendly'
   management of collections of gardens across scales from the
   neighbourhood to the city.}},

	Abstract = {{Physiological research aimed at understanding current global change
   provides a basis for evaluating selective survivoyship associated with
   Permo-Triassic mass extinction. Comparative physiology links
   paleontological and palcoenvironmental observations, supporting the
   hypothesis that an end-Permian trigger, most likely Siberian Trap
   volcanism, touched off a set of physically-l inked perturbations that
   acted synergistically to disrupt the metabolisms of latest Permian
   organisms. Global wan-ning, anoxia, and toxic sulfide probably all
   contributed to end-Permian mass mortality, but hypercapnia
   (physiological effects of elevated P-CO2) best accounts for the
   selective survival of marine invertebrates. Paleophysiological
   perspectives further suggest that persistent or recurring
   hypercapnia/global warmth also played a principal role in delayed
   Triassic recovery. More generally, physiology provides an important way
   of paleobiological knowing in the age of Earth system science. (C) 2007

@article{Nunez_2013,
	Abstract = {{As the climate changes, human land use may impede species from tracking
   areas with suitable climates. Maintaining connectivity between areas of
   different temperatures could allow organisms to move along temperature
   gradients and allow species to continue to occupy the same temperature
   space as the climate warms. We used a coarse-filter approach to identify
   broad corridors for movement between areas where human influence is low
   while simultaneously routing the corridors along present-day spatial
   gradients of temperature. We modified a costdistance algorithm to model
   these corridors and tested the model with data on current land-use and
   climate patterns in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The
   resulting maps identified a network of patches and corridors across
   which species may move as climates change. The corridors are likely to
   be robust to uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of future
   climate change because they are derived from gradients and land-use
   patterns. The assumptions we applied in our model simplified the
   stability of temperature gradients and species responses to climate
   change and land use, but the model is flexible enough to be tailored to
   specific regions by incorporating other climate variables or movement
   costs. When used at appropriate resolutions, our approach may be of
   value to local, regional, and continental conservation initiatives
   seeking to promote species movements in a changing climate.}},

	Abstract = {{Recent climatic change in temperate regions has been rapid and there is
   mounting speculation that species are failing to keep track of suitable
   climate, perhaps necessitating assisted colonization for some species.
   An inability to spread into new areas may result in large reductions in
   species' ranges in the future, and threaten the survival of some
   species. Here we use ``species-climate{''} models to predict suitable
   sites for introductions beyond current range margins, using two U. K.
   butterfly species. We introduced Melanargia galathea (marbled white) and
   Thymelicus sylvestris (small skipper) into two sites in northern
   England, similar to 65 and similar to 35 km beyond their then-range
   margins, respectively, to sites that were predicted to be climatically
   suitable and that appeared to contain suitable habitat for the species.
   Both introduced populations grew and expanded their range over 6 years
   (2001-2006; still thriving in 2008), suggesting the existence of a
   colonization lag and providing evidence that well-planned assisted
   colonization can be successful. We suggest that assisted colonization
   may be a feasible and cost-effective means of enabling certain species
   to track climatic change.}},

@article{Colwell_2008,
	Abstract = {{Many studies suggest that global warming is driving species ranges
   poleward and toward higher elevations at temperate latitudes, but
   evidence for range shifts is scarce for the tropics, where the shallow
   latitudinal temperature gradient makes upslope shifts more likely than
   poleward shifts. Based on new data for plants and insects on an
   elevational transect in Costa Rica, we assess the potential for lowland
   biotic attrition, range-shift gaps, and mountaintop extinctions under
   projected warming. We conclude that tropical lowland biotas may face a
   level of net lowland biotic attrition without parallel at higher
   latitudes (where range shifts may be compensated for by species from
   lower latitudes) and that a high proportion of tropical species soon
   faces gaps between current and projected elevational ranges.}},

The formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in primary production and consequent worldwide coastal eutrophication fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. Dead zones have now been reported from more than 400 systems, affecting a total area of more than 245,000 square kilometers, and are probably a key stressor on marine ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The species richness of ecosystems can remain stable over time, despite changes in species composition and changes in the dominant plant species. While this pattern of stability is known to occur temporally, it has been examined poorly in a spatial context. To examine this spatially, the species richness, diversity and composition of native woodlands (of oak and bay trees) and exotic woodlands (of eucalypt trees) were compared in California. Species richness was nearly identical for understorey plants, leaf-litter invertebrates, amphibians and birds; only rodents had significantly fewer species in eucalypt sites. Species diversity patterns (using the Shannon--Wiener Index) were qualitatively identical to those for species richness, except for leaf-litter invertebrates, which were significantly more diverse in eucalypt sites during the spring. Species composition was different between sites, as evidenced by a principal components analysis, coefficients of similarity, and the relatively few species shared between native and eucalypt sites. Thus, the consistency in richness and diversity observed for most groups, in most seasons, occurred despite significant differences in species composition. These results are consistent with previous demonstrations of temporal stability, suggesting that species richness may often be stable, both temporally and spatially, despite changes in composition and regardless of the dominant vegetation.},

	Abstract = {Specialization is a concept based on a broad theoretical framework developed by evolutionary biologists and ecologists. In the past 10 years, numerous studies have reported that -- in many contexts -- generalist species are ``replacing'' specialist species. We review recent research on the concept of the ecological niche and species specialization, and conclude that (1) the observed worldwide decline in specialist species is predicted by niche theory, (2) specialist declines cause ``functional homogenization'' of biodiversity, and (3) such homogenization may be used to measure the impact of disturbance on communities. Homogenization at the community level could alter ecosystem functioning and productivity, as well as result in the deterioration of ecosystem goods and services. We propose community-level specialization as an indicator of the impact of global changes (habitat and climate disturbances) on biodiversity.},

@article{Cleland_2012,
	Abstract = {Earlier spring phenology observed in many plant species in recent decades provides compelling evidence that species are already responding to the rising global temperatures associated with anthropogenic climate change. There is great variability among species, however, in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. Species that do not phenologically ``track'' climate change may be at a disadvantage if their growth becomes limited by missed interactions with mutualists, or a shorter growing season relative to earlier-active competitors. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that phenological sensitivity could be used to predict species performance in a warming climate, by synthesizing results across terrestrial warming experiments. We assembled data for 57 species across 24 studies where flowering or vegetative phenology was matched with a measure of species performance. Performance metrics included biomass, percent cover, number of flowers, or individual growth. We found that species that advanced their phenology with warming also increased their performance, whereas those that did not advance tended to decline in performance with warming. This indicates that species that cannot phenologically ``track'' climate may be at increased risk with future climate change, and it suggests that phenological monitoring may provide an important tool for setting future conservation priorities.},

Conclusions 193 Acknowledgements 193 References 193 Appendices196 Summary The effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetative growth and competitive performance were evaluated, using five meta-analyses. Paying special attention to functional groups, we analysed responses at three integration levels: carbon economy parameters, vegetative biomass of isolated plants, and growth in competition. CO2 effects on seed biomass and plant-to-plant variability were also studied. Underlying the growth stimulation is an increased unit leaf rate (ULR), especially for herbaceous dicots. This is mainly caused by an increase in the whole-plant rate of photosynthesis. The increased ULR is accompanied by a decrease in specific leaf area. The net result of these and other changes is that relative growth rate is only marginally stimulated. The biomass enhancement ratio (BER) of individually grown plants varies substantially across experiments/species, and size variability in the experimental populations is a vital factor in this. Fast-growing herbaceous C3 species respond more strongly than slow-growing C3 herbs or C4 plants. CAM species and woody plants show intermediate responses. When grown in competition, C4 species show lowest responses to elevated CO2 at high nutrient conditions, whereas at low nutrient levels N2-fixing dicots respond relatively strongly. No systematic differences were found between slow- and fast-growing species. BER values obtained for isolated plants cannot be used to estimate BER of the same species grown in interspecific competition -- the CO2 response of monocultures may be a better predictor.},

	Abstract = {The relationships among species{\textquoteright} physiological capacities and the geographical variation of ambient climate are of key importance to understanding the distribution of life on the Earth. Furthermore, predictions of how species will respond to climate change will profit from the explicit consideration of their physiological tolerances. The climatic variability hypothesis, which predicts that climatic tolerances are broader in more variable climates, provides an analytical framework for studying these relationships between physiology and biogeography. However, direct empirical support for the hypothesis is mostly lacking for endotherms, and few studies have tried to integrate physiological data into assessments of species{\textquoteright} climatic vulnerability at the global scale. Here, we test the climatic variability hypothesis for endotherms, with a comprehensive dataset on thermal tolerances derived from physiological experiments, and use these data to assess the vulnerability of species to projected climate change. We find the expected relationship between thermal tolerance and ambient climatic variability in birds, but not in mammals{\textemdash}a contrast possibly resulting from different adaptation strategies to ambient climate via behaviour, morphology or physiology. We show that currently most of the species are experiencing ambient temperatures well within their tolerance limits and that in the future many species may be able to tolerate projected temperature increases across significant proportions of their distributions. However, our findings also underline the high vulnerability of tropical regions to changes in temperature and other threats of anthropogenic global changes. Our study demonstrates that a better understanding of the interplay among species{\textquoteright} physiology and the geography of climate change will advance assessments of species{\textquoteright} vulnerability to climate change.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people.
