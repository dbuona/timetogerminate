	Abstract = {Phenology affects nearly all aspects of ecology and evolution. Virtually all biological phenomena{\textemdash}from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes{\textemdash}have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.},

@article{Leverett2017,
	Abstract = {{A single plant can interact both positively and negatively with its
   neighbors through the processes of facilitation and competition,
   respectively. Much of the variation in the balance of facilitation and
   competition that individuals experience can be explained by the degree
   of physical stress and the sizes or ages of plants during the
   interaction. Germination phenology partly controls both of these
   factors, but its role in defining the facilitation-competition balance
   has not been explicitly considered. I performed an experiment in a
   population of the winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) to
   test whether germinating during physically stressful periods leads to
   facilitation while germinating during periods that promote growth and
   reproduction leads to competition. I manipulated germination and
   neighbor presence across two years in order to quantify the effects of
   the local plant community on survival, fecundity, and total fitness as a
   function of germination phenology. Neighbors increased survival when
   germination occurred under conditions that were unsuitable for survival,
   but they reduced fecundity in germinants that were otherwise the most
   fecund. Later germination was associated with facilitation in the first
   year but competition in the second year. These episodes of facilitation
   and competition opposed each other, leading to no net effect of
   neighbors when averaged over all cohorts. These results indicate that
   variation in germination timing can explain some of the variation in the
   facilitation-competition balance in plant communities.}},

@article{Yang2010,
	Abstract = {{Climate change is altering the phenology of many species and the timing
   of their interactions with other species, but the impacts of these
   phenological shifts on species interactions remain unclear. Classical
   approaches to the study of phenology have typically documented changes
   in the timing of single life-history events, while phenological shifts
   affect many interactions over entire life histories. In this study, we
   suggest an approach that integrates the phenology and ontogeny of
   species interactions with a fitness landscape to provide a common
   mechanistic framework for investigating phenological shifts. We suggest
   that this ontogeny-phenology landscape provides a flexible method to
   document changes in the relative phenologies of interacting species,
   examine the causes of these phenological shifts, and estimate their
   consequences for interacting species.

@article{Ovaskainen2013,
	Abstract = {Climate change may disrupt interspecies phenological synchrony, with adverse consequences to ecosystem functioning. We present here a 40-y-long time series on 10,425 dates that were systematically collected in a single Russian locality for 97 plant, 78 bird, 10 herptile, 19 insect, and 9 fungal phenological events, as well as for 77 climatic events related to temperature, precipitation, snow, ice, and frost. We show that species are shifting their phenologies at dissimilar rates, partly because they respond to different climatic factors, which in turn are shifting at dissimilar rates. Plants have advanced their spring phenology even faster than average temperature has increased, whereas migratory birds have shown more divergent responses and shifted, on average, less than plants. Phenological events of birds and insects were mainly triggered by climate cues (variation in temperature and snow and ice cover) occurring over the course of short periods, whereas many plants, herptiles, and fungi were affected by long-term climatic averages. Year-to-year variation in plants, herptiles, and insects showed a high degree of synchrony, whereas the phenological timing of fungi did not correlate with any other taxonomic group. In many cases, species that are synchronous in their year-to-year dynamics have also shifted in congruence, suggesting that climate change may have disrupted phenological synchrony less than has been previously assumed. Our results illustrate how a multidimensional change in the physical environment has translated into a community-level change in phenology.},

@article{Cleland2012,
	Abstract = {Earlier spring phenology observed in many plant species in recent decades provides compelling evidence that species are already responding to the rising global temperatures associated with anthropogenic climate change. There is great variability among species, however, in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. Species that do not phenologically ``track'' climate change may be at a disadvantage if their growth becomes limited by missed interactions with mutualists, or a shorter growing season relative to earlier-active competitors. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that phenological sensitivity could be used to predict species performance in a warming climate, by synthesizing results across terrestrial warming experiments. We assembled data for 57 species across 24 studies where flowering or vegetative phenology was matched with a measure of species performance. Performance metrics included biomass, percent cover, number of flowers, or individual growth. We found that species that advanced their phenology with warming also increased their performance, whereas those that did not advance tended to decline in performance with warming. This indicates that species that cannot phenologically ``track'' climate may be at increased risk with future climate change, and it suggests that phenological monitoring may provide an important tool for setting future conservation priorities.},

@article{Chuine2001,
	Abstract = {{Global warming is expected to have a major impact on plant
   distributions, an issue of key importance in biological conservation.
   However, very few models are able to predict species distribution
   accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate
   change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree
   species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological
   processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as
   a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power
   when tested against present distributions of two North American species
   - quaking aspen and sugar maple - indicating that on a broad scale, the
   fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche.
   Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range
   and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global
   warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.}},

@article{Menzel2006,
	Abstract = {{Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical
   and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a
   consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators
   is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded
   dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus,
   numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events
   for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season.
   However, published single-site or single-species studies are
   particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly
   reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or
   meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for
   changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We
   used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than
   125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21
   European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all
   leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly)
   and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf
   colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published
   results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or
   publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5
   days decade(-1) in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series
   undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to
   temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by
   2.5 days degrees C(-1), delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day
   degrees C(-1)). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently
   matches measured national warming across 19 European countries
   (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P < 0.001).}},

@article{Piao2007,
	Abstract = {A number of studies have suggested that the growing season duration has significantly lengthened during the past decades, but the connections between phenology variability and the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are far from clear. In this study, we used the ``ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems'' (ORCHIDEE) process based ecosystem model together with observed climate data to investigate spatiotemporal changes in phenology and their impacts on carbon fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere (>25$\,^{\circ}$N) during 1980--2002. We found that the growing season length (GSL) has increased by 0.30 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.27, P = 0.010), owing to the combination of an earlier onset in spring (0.16 days yr−1) and a later termination in autumn (0.14 days yr−1). Trends in the GSL are however highly variable across the regions. In Eurasia, there is a significant trend toward earlier vegetation green-up with an overall advancement rate of 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.005), while in North America there is a significantly delayed vegetation senescence by 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.013) during the study period. Our results also suggested that the GSL strongly correlates with annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP), indicating that longer growing seasons may eventually enhance vegetation growth. A 1-day extension in GSL leads to an increase in annual GPP of 5.8 gC m−2 yr−1 (or 0.6\% per day), and an increase in NPP of 2.8 gC m−2 yr−1 per day. However, owing to enhanced soil carbon decomposition accompanying the GPP increase, a change in GSL correlates only poorly with a change in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP).},
