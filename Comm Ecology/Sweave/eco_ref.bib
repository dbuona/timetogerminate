@article{Goldberg_1992,
	Abstract = {{We present a quantitative literature review to assess the extent to
   which field experiments with plants have addressed questions about
   patterns of competition over time and space, consequences of competition
   for community structure, and comparisons of competitive ability among
   species. We outline the necessary treatment comparisons and statistical
   analyses to answer each question and then describe the number of
   experiments that meet these criteria and their results. Although we
   found a total of 101 experiments in 89 studies, 63\% of these
   experiments only addressed whether competition significantly affected
   some component of individual fitness of a single species at a single
   time and site. Despite the limited data base to address more complex
   questions about competitive interactions, we did find consistent results
   for a few of the questions we reviewed. Where tested, competition always
   had significant effects on distribution patterns (five experiments), on
   relative abundances (two experiments), and on diversity (four
   experiments), consistent with the notion that competition has strong
   effects on community structure. On the other hand, intraspecific
   competition was not usually stronger than interspecific competition for
   either competitive effect (four experiments) or response (three
   experiments), which suggests that resource partitioning may not be an
   important mechanism of coexistence in plants.}},

@article{Stearns_2000,
	Abstract = {{Life history theory tries to explain how evolution designs organisms to
   achieve reproductive success. The design is a solution to an ecological
   problem posed by the environment and subject to constraints intrinsic to
   the organism. Work on life histories has expanded the role of phenotypes
   in evolutionary theory, extending the range of predictions from genetic
   patterns to whole-organism traits directly connected to fitness. Among
   the questions answered are the following: Why are organisms small or
   large? Why do they mature early or late? Why do they have few or many
   offspring? Why do they have a short or a long life? Why must they grow
   old and die? The classical approach to life histories was optimization;
   it has had some convincing empirical success. Recently non-equilibrium
   approaches involving frequency-dependence, density-dependence,
   evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and explicit population
   dynamics have supplanted optimization as the preferred approach. They
   have not yet had as much empirical success, but there are logical
   reasons to prefer them, and they may soon extend the impact of life
   history theory into population dynamics and interspecific interactions
   in coevolving communities.}},

@article{Folke_2004,
	Abstract = {{We review the evidence of regime shifts in terrestrial and aquatic
   environments in relation to resilience of complex adaptive ecosystems
   and the functional roles of biological diversity in this context. The
   evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when
   humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity,
   removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic
   levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants
   and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration
   of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of
   those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that
   previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly
   shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate
   ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of
   resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and
   transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable
   configurations.}},

@article{Velland_2010,
	Abstract = {{Community ecology is often perceived as a ``mess,{''} given the
   seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns
   of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However,
   at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of
   species-the subject matter of community ecology-are influenced by only
   four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal.
   Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species,
   drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation
   creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across
   space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be
   understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes.
   Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their
   interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing
   the material of community ecology according to this framework can
   clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many
   conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also
   allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community
   dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal,
   and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift
   and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community
   dynamics.}},

@article{Tillman_1999,
	Abstract = {{This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of
   diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A
   model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause
   community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease.
   These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal
   variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the
   differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community
   stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance
   effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem
   productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota
   grasslands supports these predictions.
   Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that
   greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This
   diversity-productivity relationship results both from the greater chance
   that a more productive speicies would be present at higher diversity
   (the sampling effect) and from the better ``coverage{''} of habitat
   heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more
   diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause
   more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity,
   which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity.
   Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher
   diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem
   to invasion, supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This
   mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance.
   In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition,
   disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of
   population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly
   great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely
   to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems
   worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed
   if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for
   wise management of the earth and its biological resources.}},

   understanding of many aspects of invasions. The review focuses on
   vascular plants invading natural and semi-natural ecosystems, and on
   fundamental ecological issues relating to species invasiveness and
   community invasibility. Three big questions addressed by the SCOPE
   programme in the 1980s (which species invade; which habitats are
   invaded; and how can we manage invasions?) still underpin most work in
   invasion ecology. Some organizing and unifying themes in the field are
   organism-focused and relate to species invasiveness (the tens rule; the
   concept of residence time; taxonomic patterns and Darwin's
   naturalization hypothesis; issues of phenotypic plasticity and rapid
   evolutionary change, including evolution of increased competitive
   ability hypothesis; the role of long-distance dispersal). Others are
   ecosystem-centred and deal with determinants of the invasibility of
   communities, habitats and regions (levels of invasion, invasibility and
   propagule pressure; the biotic resistance hypothesis and the links
   between diversity and invasibility; synergisms, mutualisms, and
   invasional meltdown). Some theories have taken an overarching approach
   to plant invasions by integrating the concepts of species invasiveness
   and community invasibility (a theory of seed plant invasiveness;
   fluctuating resources theory of invasibility). Concepts, hypotheses and
   theories reviewed here can be linked to the naturalization-invasion
   continuum concept, which relates invasion processes with a sequence of
   environmental and biotic barriers that an introduced species must
   negotiate to become casual, naturalized and invasive. New research tools
   and improved research links between invasion ecology and succession
   ecology, community ecology, conservation biology and weed science,
   respectively, have strengthened the conceptual pillars of invasion
   ecology.}},

   ecosystem functioning. We highlight here the crucial role of
   beta-diversity - a hitherto underexplored facet of biodiversity - for a
   better process-level understanding of biodiversity change and its
   consequences for ecosystems. A focus on beta-diversity has the potential
   to improve predictions of natural and anthropogenic influences on
   diversity and ecosystem functioning. However, linking the causes and
   consequences of biodiversity change is complex because species
   assemblages in nature are shaped by many factors simultaneously,
   including disturbance, environmental heterogeneity, deterministic niche
   factors, and stochasticity. Because variability and change are
   ubiquitous in ecosystems, acknowledging these inherent properties of
   nature is an essential step for further advancing scientific knowledge
   of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning in theory and practice.}},

	Abstract = {{A leading idea about how disturbances and other environmental
   fluctuations affect species diversity is the intermediate disturbance
   hypothesis (IDH). The IDH states that diversity of competing species is,
   or should be expected to be, maximized at intermediate frequencies
   and/or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. I argue that
   the IDH has been refuted on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and
   so should be abandoned. Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted
   humped diversity disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three
   major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity disturbance
   relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what
   they are thought to predict. Disturbances and other environmental
   fluctuations can affect diversity, but for different reasons than are
   commonly recognized.}},

   incorporates the several varieties of migration, and includes all levels
   of biological organization, from genes to populations. The scheme links
   the environment, pathways, traits, and genes, and highlights the
   selective forces that shape and maintain migratory adaptation. We
   endorse an individual-based behavioral definition of migration that
   allows an objective distinction between migration and other forms of
   movement. We recognize migration as an adaptation to resources that
   fluctuate spatiotemporally either seasonally or less predictably, and
   note that it is often preemptive. Migration plays a central role in the
   spatial dynamics of mobile populations, and is largely distinct in both
   form and function from the within-population mixing arising from
   postnatal dispersal and from the interpatch movements characteristic of
   metapopulations. We call for more interaction between biologists
   studying different taxa and different forms of movement, and between
   behaviorists and population ecologists.}},

	Abstract = {{This review discusses the interface between two of the most important
   types of interactions between species, interspecific competition and
   predation. Predation has been claimed to increase, decrease, or have
   little effect on, the strength, impact or importance of interspecific
   competition. There is confusion about both the meaning these terms and
   the likelihood of, and conditions required for, each of these outcomes.
   In this article we distinguish among three measures of the influence of
   predation on competitive outcomes: short-term per capita consumption or
   growth rates, long-term changes in density and the probability of
   competitive coexistence. We then outline various theoretical mechanisms
   that can lead to qualitatively, distinct effects. of predators,. The
   qualitative effect of predators can depend both on the mechanism of
   competition and on the definition of competitive strength/impact. In
   assessing the empirical literature, we ask: (1) What definitions of
   competitive strength/impact have been assumed? (2) Does strong evidence
   exist to support one or more of the possible mechanisms that can produce
   a given outcome? (3) Do biases in the choice of organism or manipulation
   exist, and are they, likely, to have influenced the conclusions reached?
   We conclude by discussing several unanswered questions, and espouse a
   stronger interchange between empirical and theoretical approaches to
   this important question.}},

	Abstract = {{During the seven decades of gray wolf (Canis lupus) absence in
   Yellowstone National Park intensive browsing by Rocky Mountain elk
   (Cervus elaphus) suppressed the growth of young deciduous woody plants
   within the park's northern ungulate winter range. Since wolf
   reintroduction, 24 assessments of deciduous woody plants in riparian
   areas have been published, including eleven on willow (Salix spp.), six
   on aspen (Populus tremuloides), five on cottonwood (Populus angustifolia
   and Populus trichocarpa), and one each on berry-producing shrubs and
   thinleaf alder (Alnus incana spp. tenuifolia). All but two of these
   studies found increases in plant height, stem diameter, stem
   establishment, canopy cover, or recruitment. More than half of the
   studies measured ungulate browsing and, in all instances, increased
   growth/cover of woody plants over time occurred concurrently with a
   decrease in browsing. Almost half of the studies also compared observed
   plant community changes to climatic/hydrologic variables but the results
   of these analyses were often inconsistent. Although the long-term
   warming and drying trends underway in northern Yellowstone appear
   unlikely to have contributed to the occurrence of improved riparian
   plant communities during the last two decades, these vegetation changes
   were consistent with reestablishment of a tri-trophic cascade involving
   an intact large predator guild, elk, and woody plant species. This early
   stage of vegetation recovery in northern Yellowstone, although not
   occurring everywhere, represents a major departure from the wide-spread
   suppression of woody plants by elk browsing that occurred in the decades
   when wolves were absent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

	Abstract = {{Evolution may be dominated by biotic factors, as in the Red Queen model,
   or abiotic factors, as in the Court Jester model, or a mixture of both.
   The two models appear to operate predominantly over different geographic
   and temporal scales: Competition, predation, and other biotic factors
   shape ecosystems locally and over short time spans, but extrinsic
   factors such as climate and oceanographic and tectonic events shape
   larger- scale patterns regionally and globally, and through thousands
   and millions of years. Paleobiological studies suggest that species
   diversity is driven largely by abiotic factors such as climate,
   landscape, or food supply, and comparative phylogenetic approaches offer
   new insights into clade dynamics.}},
